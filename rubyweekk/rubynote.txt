Why Ruby?
===================
Object oriented programming
	(There are procedural/structural programming in practice as well called functional planning)
Is is a pure OO language
	even integer, static true are objects in Ruby (Complete OO thinking)
It's dynamic (unlike C or C++, we can change the way the methids work)
Interpreted language (smaller binary and no need for interpreter)
it has a nice syntax (derived from a mismass of pearl, python and other programming languages)
It is easier to learn

ISO/IEC
30170:2012
============================

DRY
(Don't repeat yourself)


code tips
==============
strings ''
adding or combining two strings ''+''

#can multiply string by integer but cant multiply integer by string
 
 #puts 'Hello it\'s nice'

 #escape apostrophe (\)

 #(chomp strips off character return (pressing enter after name for instance))

what a case statement does in ruby

Hash{}

my_hash[1]
my_hash[2]


def ask_recursively(question)
